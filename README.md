# SketchFlow

**Purpose** : 

This application offers Firebase-based authentication through Google accounts for the purpose of user login. It also manages the storage of these login credentials within a Room Database. Additionally, the application ensures that session information is promptly cleared during the logout process. The application consists of three distinct fragments that serve various purposes: the first displays different categories of movies, the second showcases GitHub users, and the third presents a user interface resembling a video chat platform. This video chat interface is integrated with ExoPlayer for media playback and includes engaging animations.
